# playground

trying out different things like widget-toolkits, graphics apis,
some projects from the internet, some programming books. these are
prototypes. these also include other open source projects which i find
interesting and dive deep into.

i write these on archlinux, so most of the projects have a makefile or
two. those which have cmake files are bulit on windows too, on msys2.
